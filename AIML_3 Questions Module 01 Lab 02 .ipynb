Test accuracy should always be evaluated on a separate, unseen test set to ensure an unbiased and realistic assessment of the model's performance in real-world applications. Cross-validation helps in ensuring that the model is well-generalized and robust based on the training data, facilitating better decisions in model selection and tuning."
